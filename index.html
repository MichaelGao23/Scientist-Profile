                    <strong>Aerodynamics and Propulsion is a heavily researched theme in the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering department. This comes with many areas of expertise such as aerodynamic characterization and high speed aerodynamics and propulsion using laser diagnostics. 

                        A few research projects include the development of a solid-propellant air-breathing rocket engine, as well as using flow field estimation techniques which utilizes sensors, which can be applied to bluff body flows and vehicle aerodynamics.
                        
                        Some core focuses of labs and groups involved with Aerodynamics and Propulsion include aerospace vehicle development and flight testing, bluff body aerodynamics, flow control, and turbulence.

                    <strong>The departments of Electrical & Software and Mechanical & Manufacturing Engineering both research Robotics and UAV thoroughly. The various areas of expertise and research projects includes robotic machining, control and deployment of robots and UAVs within confined spaces, human collaborative robots for space explorations, and radio frequency (RF) links for UAV applications.

                        Some core focuses of facilities involved with Robotics and UAV include the study of diverse methodologies such as AI or machining for applications to robots or unmanned aerial vehicles.

                    <strong>Many departments are involved with research in Space Systems. Namely Physics and Astronomy, Electrical and Software Engineering, and Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering. This allows for multiple research and development projects to take place that cover a broad range of issues and topics. 

                        Specifically, this includes the development of scientific instrumentation for sounding rockets and cubesats, and satellite based instrumentation to measure the ionosphere and its interaction with the upper atmosphere and aurora. As well, the development of spaceflight hardware to explore high energy particles, space electronics for satellite and deep space communications, and T/R modules for satellite communication. There is also research being done on the use of novel lubricants and high strength materials to improve these aerospace systems.
